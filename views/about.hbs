  <h1>About</h1>

  <p>JSDocs provides a free hosting documentation service for open source <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> projects that are publicy available on <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>.</p>

  <p>JSDocs displays documentation of any JavaScript project that follows <a href="http://usejsdoc.org">jsdoc</a> conventions. Docs are powered by <a href="http://documentation.js.org/">documentation.js</a>.</p>

  <p>The source code for JSDocs is available <a href="https://github.com/jsdocs/jsdocs">on GitHub</a>.</p>

  <p>JSDocs has been inspired by other community documentation providers such as RubyDoc and GoDoc.</p>

  <h3>Add a package to JSDocs</h3>

  <p>JSDocs generates documentation directly parsing the annotations from the source code. Your package must follow the <a href="http://usejsdoc.org">jsdoc</a> conventions <a href="https://github.com/documentationjs/documentation/blob/master/docs/GETTING_STARTED.md">guidelines</a> while writing documentation in your packages.</p>

  <p>To add a package to JS Docs just access to the URL <i>http://jsdocs.org/github.com/{organization}/{repository}</i>, replacing the placeholders with your package information. If JSDocs does not already have the documentation for the package, then JSDocs will fetch the source from the version control system on the fly and add the documentation.</p>

  <p>JSDocs checks for package updates once per day. You should be able in a future to force JS Docs to update the documentation immediately by clicking the refresh link at the bottom of the package documentation page.</p>
